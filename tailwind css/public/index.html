        A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed
        bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is
        usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres above the surrounding land.Maybe we can live
        without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that
        kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees
        and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?

        Look. If you think this is about overdue fines and missing books, you'd better think again. This is about that
        kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or: maybe that turns you on, Seinfeld; maybe that's
        how y'get your kicks. You and your good-time buddies.
